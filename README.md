**Price Distribution:**

>     - The highest average prices are in 中山區 (588 TWD) and 大安區 (583 TWD), both over 1.7 standard deviations above the mean.
>     - The lowest average prices are in 文山區 (235 TWD), 1.35 standard deviations below the mean.
> - Approximately 68% of districts have average prices within 114.37 TWD of the overall mean (389 ± 114.37 TWD).


 **Category Variety:**
> 
> - The extremely small standard deviation for category variety (less than 1) indicates very little variation in the number of categories across districts. → Most districts have similar category variety, clustering around 76 categories.
> - This suggests that regardless of location or price level, most districts offer a similar variety of cuisine types.
> - 大同區 has the highest variety with 79 categories, while 南港區 has the lowest with 71.


 **Price vs. Variety Relationship:**
> 
> - The districts with the highest prices (中山區 and 大安區) also have above-average category variety.
> - There are no districts that clearly fit the criteria of "high prices but low variety" that we were initially looking for.
  

 **Restaurant Density:**
> There is a significant concentration of restaurants in a few key districts, with a long tail of districts having fewer establishments.
> 
> 
> The top three districts account for 46% of all restaurants in the dataset.

> - 中山區 (Zhongshan District): 1,835 restaurants (16% of total)
> - 信義區 (Xinyi District): 1,113 restaurants (10% of total)

> Local Economies:  The distribution likely reflects the economic and demographic characteristics of each district. 大安區, 中山區,  信義區 are likely to be the major commercial or tourist centers, while lower-density areas may be more residential or industrial.
> 

> Consumer Behavior: The concentration of restaurants might indicate where people prefer to dine out, which could be influenced by factors such as workplace locations, entertainment venues, or transportation hubs.
